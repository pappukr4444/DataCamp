Guess the type - 50 XP
==============================================================

To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value, you can use the type() function. Suppose you've defined a variable a, but you forgot the type of this variable. To determine the type of a, simply execute:

type(a)

We already went ahead and created three variables: a, b and c. You can use the IPython shell on the right to discover their type. Which of the following options is correct?

Possible Answers
	1. a is of type int, b is of type str, c is of type bool
	2. a is of type float, b is of type bool, c is of type str
	3. a is of type float, b is of type str, c is of type bool
	4. a is of type int, b is of type bool, c is of type str


Code

In [1]: type(a)
Out[1]: float

In [2]: type(b)
Out[2]: str

In [3]: type(c)
Out[3]: bool
